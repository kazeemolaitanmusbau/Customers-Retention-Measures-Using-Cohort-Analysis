# Customers Retention Measures Using Cohort Analysis
 
# Introduction

A cohort is a collection of users who have something in common. A traditional cohort, for example, divides people by the week or month of which they were first acquired. When referring to non-time-dependent groupings, the term segment is often used instead of the cohort.

Cohort analysis is a descriptive analytics technique in cohort analysis. Customers are divided into mutually exclusive cohorts, which are then tracked over time.

[Cohort Analysis](https://medium.com/swlh/cohort-analysis-using-python-and-pandas-d2a60f4d0a4d) is specifically useful in analyzing user growth patterns for products. In terms of a product, a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign-up date, the same usage starts month/date, or the same traffic source.
Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time for finding key insights. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics like retention, churn, and lifetime value.

For e-commerce organizations, cohort analysis is a unique opportunity to find out which clients are the most valuable to their business.

There are three types of Cohort Analysis:

**Time cohorts** are customers who have signed up for a product or service during a specified period. Analysis of these cohorts shows the behaviour of customers based on when they started using the companyâ€™s products or services. The time can be monthly or quarterly or even daily.


**Behaviour cohorts** are customers who have purchased a product or subscribed to service in the past. It groups customers according to the type of product or service to which they have subscribed. Customers who signed up for basic services may have different needs than those who signed up for advanced services. Understanding the needs of different cohorts can help a business design tailor-made services or products for particular segments.
