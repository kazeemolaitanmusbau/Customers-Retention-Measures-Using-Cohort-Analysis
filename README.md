# Customers Retention Measures Using Cohort Analysis
 
# Introduction

A cohort is a collection of users who have something in common. A traditional cohort, for example, divides people by the week or month of which they were first acquired. When referring to non-time-dependent groupings, the term segment is often used instead of the cohort.

Cohort analysis is a descriptive analytics technique in cohort analysis. Customers are divided into mutually exclusive cohorts, which are then tracked over time.

In terms of a product, a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign-up date, the same usage starts month/date, or the same traffic source.
Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time for finding key insights. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics like retention, churn, and lifetime value.

For e-commerce organizations, cohort analysis is a unique opportunity to find out which clients are the most valuable to their business.
